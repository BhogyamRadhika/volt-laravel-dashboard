[![Volt Bootstrap 5 Dashboard Preview](https://themesberg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/products/volt-bootstrap-5-dashboard/volt-bootstrap-5-dashboard-preview.jpg)](https://demo.themesberg.com/volt/)

Volt is a free and open source Laravel Admin Dashboard featuring over 100 components, 11 example pages and 3 customized plugins. Volt **does not require jQuery** as a dependency meaning that every library and script's are jQuery free.

## Bootstrap 5, Vanilla JavaScript and Laravel

Volt is built using the latest version of Bootstrap 5 and because [jQuery is no longer required as a dependency](https://themesberg.com/blog/tutorial/bootstrap-5-tutorial), Volt has been built using only Vanilla JS and Laravel.

## 100+ Components

Because it is created using the latest version of Bootstrap 5, every component and element is based on the latest Bootstrap 5 Sass variables and HTML markup. Check out the documentation of the components [here](https://themesberg.com/docs/volt-laravel-admin-dashboard/components/accordions/).

## 11 Example pages

We created no less than 11 advanced example pages such as the overview page, transactions, user settings, sign in and sign up and many more.

## Full documentation

Every component, plugin and getting started is thoroughly documented on our [online documentation](https://themesberg.com/docs/volt-laravel-admin-dashboard/getting-started/quick-start/).

## Workflow

This product is built using the following widely used technologies:

- Most popular CSS Framework Bootstrap
- Productive workflow tool Gulp
- Awesome CSS preprocessor Sass
- Laravel and Livewire

# Installation

## Prerequisites

If you don't already have an Apache local environment with PHP and MySQL, use one of the following links:

 - Windows: https://updivision.com/blog/post/beginner-s-guide-to-setting-up-your-local-development-environment-on-windows
 - Linux: https://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-install-lamp-on-ubuntu
 - Mac: https://wpshout.com/quick-guides/how-to-install-mamp-on-your-mac/

Also, you will need to install Composer: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md

## Laravel
1. Unzip the downloaded archive
2. Copy and paste **volt-dashboard-master** folder in your **projects** folder. Rename the folder to your project's name
3. In your terminal run `composer install`
4. In your terminal run `composer require livewire/livewire`
5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and updated the configurations (mainly the database configuration)
6. In your terminal run `php artisan key:generate`
7. Run `php artisan migrate --seed` to create the database tables and seed the roles and users tables
8. Run `php artisan storage:link` to create the storage symlink (if you are using **Vagrant** with **Homestead** for development, remember to ssh into your virtual machine and run the command from there).

## Gulp
1. Download from [Themesberg](https://themesberg.com/product/admin-dashboard/volt-laravel-admin-dashboard) or clone this repository
2. Download the project's zip
3. Make sure you have Node locally installed.
4. Download Gulp Command Line Interface to be able to use gulp in your Terminal.

```
npm install gulp-cli -g
```

5. After installing Gulp, run npm install in the main `volt/` folder to download all the project dependencies. You'll find them in the `node_modules/` folder.

```
npm install
```

6. Run gulp in the `volt/` folder to serve the project files using BrowserSync. Running gulp will compile the theme and open `/index.html` in your main browser.

```
gulp
```

While the gulp command is running, files in the `assets/scss/`, `assets/js/` and `components/` folders will be monitored for changes. Files from the `assets/scss/` folder will generate injected CSS.

Hit `CTRL+C` to terminate the gulp command. This will stop the local server from running.

## Theme without Sass, Gulp or npm

If you'd like to get a version of our theme without Sass, Gulp or npm, we've got you covered. Run the following command:

```
gulp build:dev
```

This will generate a folder `html&css` which will have unminified CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

## Minified version

If you'd like to compile the code and get a minified version of the HTML and CSS just run the following Gulp command:

```
gulp build:dist
```

This will generate a folder `dist` which will have minified CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

## Usage

To start testing the theme, register as a user or log in using one of the default users: 

- admin type - **admin@paper.com** with the password **secret**
- creator type - **creator@paper.com** with the password **secret**
- member type - **member@paper.com** with the password **secret**

Make sure to run the migrations and seeders for the above credentials to be available.

In addition to the features included in the free preset, the Pro theme also has a role management example with an updated user management, as well as tag management, category management and item management examples. All the necessary files (controllers, requests, views) are installed out of the box and all the needed routes are added to `routes/web.php`. Keep in mind that all the features can be viewed once you log in using the credentials provided above or by registering your own user.

Each role has a different privilege level and can perform a certain number of actions according to this level.  

A **member type** user can log in, update his profile and view a list of added items.  
A **creator type** user can log in, update his profile and perform actions on categories, tags and items.  
A **admin type** user can log in, update his profile and perform actions on categories, tags, items, roles and users.  

### Dashboard

You can access the dashboard either by using the "**Dashboard**" link in the left sidebar or by adding **/dashboard** in the URL.

### Profile edit

You have the option to edit the current logged in user's profile information (name, email, profile picture) and password. To access this page, just click the "**Settings**" link in the left sidebar or add **/profile** in the URL.

The `app/Http/Livewire/Profile.php` handles the update of the user information and password.

```
    public function mount() { $this->user = auth()->user(); }

    public function save()
    {
        if(env('IS_DEMO')) {
            $this->showDemoNotification = true;
        }
        else {
        $this->validate();

        $this->user->save();

        $this->showSavedAlert = true;
            
        }
    }
```

If you input the wrong data when editing the profile, don't worry. Validation rules have been added to prevent this.

```
    protected $rules = [
        'user.first_name' => 'max:15',
        'user.last_name' => 'max:20',
        'user.birthday' => 'date_format:Y-m-d',
        'user.email' => 'email',
        'user.phone' => 'numeric',
        'user.gender' => '',
        'user.address' => 'max:20',
        'user.number' => 'numeric',
        'user.city' => 'max:20',
        'user.zip' => 'numeric',
    ];

```

### Sign in

You have the option to log in using the email and password. To access this page, just click the "**Page examples/ Sign in**" link in the left sidebar or add **/login** in the URL.

The `app/Http/Livewire/Auth/Login.php` handles the log in process and validation.

```
   protected $rules = [
        'email' => 'required|email',
        'password' => 'required',
    ];

    public function login()
    {
        $credentials = $this->validate();
        return auth()->attempt($credentials)
                ? redirect()->intended('/profile')
                : $this->addError('email', trans('auth.failed'));
    }
```

### Sign up

You have the option to register an user using the email and password. To access this page, just click the "**Page examples/ Sign up**" link in the left sidebar or add **/register** in the URL.

The `app/Http/Livewire/Auth/Register.php` handles the register process and validation.

```
    public function updatedEmail()
    {
        $this->validate(['email'=>'required|email|unique:users']);
    }
    
    public function register()
    {
        $this->validate([
            'email' => 'required',
            'password' => 'required|same:passwordConfirmation|min:6',
        ]);

        $user = User::create([
            'email' =>$this->email,
            'password' => Hash::make($this->password),
            'remember_token' => Str::random(10),
        ]);

        auth()->login($user);

        return redirect('/profile');
    }
```
### Forgot password

You have the option to send an email containing the password reset link to an user. To access this page, just click the "**Page examples/ Forgot password**" link in the left sidebar or add **/forgot-password** in the URL.

The `app/Http/Livewire/ForgotPassword.php` handles the email submission process.

```
    public $rules=[
        'email' => 'required|email|exists:users'
    ];
    protected $messages = [
        'email.exists' => 'The Email Address must be in our database.',
    ];
    public function updatedEmail()
    {
        $this->validate(['email'=>'required|email|exists:users']);
    }
    public function routeNotificationForMail() {
        return $this->email;
    }
    public function recoverPassword() {
        if(env('IS_DEMO')) {
            $this->showDemoNotification = true;
        }
        else {
        $this->validate();
        $user=User::where('email', $this->email)->first();
        $this->notify(new ResetPassword($user->id));
        $this->mailSentAlert = true;
        }
    }
```

The `app/Notifications/ResetPassword.php` handles the email submission itself. Here you can edit the overall layout of the email.
```
    public function toMail($notifiable)
    {
        $url = URL::signedRoute('reset-password', ['id' => $this->token]);
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->subject('Reset your password')
                    ->line('Hey, did you forget your password? Click the button to reset it.')
                    ->action('Reset Password', $url)
                    ->line('Thank you for using our application!');
    }

```

### Reset password

The email sent through the forgot password process will send the user to an unique link containing the password reset form. To access an example of this page, just click the "**Page examples/ Reset password**" link in the left sidebar or add **/reset-password-example** in the URL.

The `app/Http/Livewire/ResetPassword.php` handles the password reset process and validation.

```
    public $rules=[
        'email' => 'required|email|exists:users',
        'password' => 'required|same:passwordConfirmation|min:6',
    ];
    protected $messages = [
        'email.exists' => 'The Email Address must be in our database.',
    ];

    public function updatedEmail()
    {
        $this->validate(['email'=>'required|email|exists:users']);
    }
    public function mount($id) {
        $existingUser = User::find($id);
        $this->urlId = intval($existingUser->id);
    }

    public function resetPassword() {
        $this->validate();
        $existingUser = User::where('email', $this->email)->first();
        if($existingUser && $existingUser->id == $this->urlId) {
            $existingUser->update([
                'password' => Hash::make($this->password)
            ]);
            $this->isPasswordChanged = true;
            $this->wrongEmail = false;
        }
        else {
            $this->wrongEmail = true;
        }
    }
    
```
